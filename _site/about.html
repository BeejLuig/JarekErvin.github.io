      <p>Jarek Paul Ervin is a music scholar working at the intersection of musicology, cultural studies, philosophy, and social theory. Broadly, Ervin&rsquo;s thought investigates the overlapping and often conflicting dynamics of music as aesthetic practice, social force, historical inheritance, and a privileged window into the domain of sensory experience. Recent projects have investigated these concerns within a number of areas, including the early history of popular music studies, avant-garde musical aesthetics, and the recent resurgence of white supremacist music. Ervin&rsquo;s more general concerns include: popular music studies, music history, and music theory; gender and sexuality in music; and philosophy of music, especially German Idealism and critical theory (Luk&aacute;cs, Benjamin, Bloch, and Adorno).</p>
<p>Ervin is currently a PhD candidate in University of Virginia&rsquo;s McIntire Department of Music. His dissertation concentrates on the fraught character of New York&rsquo;s iconic punk scene of the 1970s. Drawing on a range of archival, critical, and recorded materials, Ervin&rsquo;s project focuses on the way the category of punk served as a fragile placeholder for a range of artists including Velvet Underground, Jayne County, Patti Smith, the Ramones, and Blondie. Along the way, Ervin examines the way punk&rsquo;s elusive character carved out a unique space for re-evaluating music at the intersection of the historical, the discursive, and the aesthetic. Ultimately, this leads to an interrogation of broader issues related to genre theory, gender and sexual identity, and popular music&rsquo;s troubled history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ervin&rsquo;s work has appeared at a number of recent conferences, including Left Forum 2014 and IASPM-US 2016; this fall, he will present at the joint meeting of AMS and SMT. Ervin has held fellowships from the Library of Congress and UVa&rsquo;s Vice President's Office for Research, and in 2015 was the Gladys Krieble Delmas Visiting Scholar at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&rsquo;s Library and Archives. In 2016, his work will be supported by a Battestin Fellowship from the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia.</p>
